# ðŸ”— Content Aggregation Application
Overview
The Content Aggregation Application is a Python-based tool designed to fetch and summarize news articles on any topic of interest. It provides an overview of the topic using Wikipedia, scores articles based on relevance, and visualizes the scores using interactive charts.

Features
TF-IDF-based Summarization: Extracts concise summaries from full-text articles or summaries.

Wikipedia Integration: Retrieves a brief overview or theory about the queried topic.

Relevance Scoring: Assigns relevance scores to articles based on query keywords using softmax normalization.

Visual Charts: Displays a bar chart of article relevance scores using Altair.

User Authentication: Login functionality for access control.

Technologies Used
Python: The core language for the application.

Streamlit: For building the user interface.

BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content.

TF-IDF (Scikit-learn): For text summarization.

Newspaper3k: To extract full-text articles from URLs.

Wikipedia API: For fetching related theories.

Altair: For visualizing relevance scores.
